Ics.py is a pythonic and easy iCalendar library. It's goals are to read and write ics data in a developer friendly way.

iCalendar is a widely-used and useful format but not user friendly. Ics.py is there to give you the ability of creating and reading this format without any knowledge of it.

It should be able to parse every calendar that respects the `rfc5545 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545>`_ and maybe some more… It also outputs rfc compliant calendars.

iCalendar (file extension `.ics`) is used by Sunbird, Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Android…


Ics.py is available for Python>=2.7 *and* Python>=3.3 and is Apache2 Licensed.

Personal version put here for cloning. Made by my lil buddy

This can properly read .ics from outlook where .now() reports a time that is very much wrong
